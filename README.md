# Superstore-Data-ETL-and-Validation

Developed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process raw retail sales data, ensuring data quality 
and consistency. Implemented data validation checks using Great Expectations, including verifying column 
completeness, data types, and adherence to business rules (e.g., 'Category' values, 'Discount' ranges, unique 
'Row ID').
